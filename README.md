# initialproject

### A initial flutter project by Swivt app developement team. This project uses getIt for dependency injection and flavors for dev, uat & prod built.

## Getting Started

#### Setup
1) Fork Project from the original repository
2) setup upstream (optional)
3) Replace package name ```com.organization.initialproject``` with your `com.yourorganization.yourprojectname`. (shift+cmd+R in Android Studio and shift+cmd+H in vscode IDE)
4) Android creates folder according to package name so we need to change that as well which is located at `/android/app/src/main/kotlin`
5) Define flavor arguments for project if not already, pass `dev`, `uat` or `prod` in arguments field or you can run though command `flutter run --flavor dev` 
6) Clean the project with flutter clean ^_^
7) You should see Hello Devs!! printed on the screen.
